Installation
=============


1)
You may want to do a backup copy of the following files because these will be overwritten:

admin/controller/common/header.php
admin/language/english/common/header.php
admin/view/template/common/header.tpl
catalog/controller/common/footer.php
catalog/view/theme/default/template/common/footer.tpl


2) 
Copy the files from the 'add_files' and 'changed_files' directory to your target 
installation directory of OpenCart.



3) 
After installation, the following menu files are now overwritten:

admin/controller/common/header.php
admin/language/english/common/header.php
admin/view/template/common/header.tpl
catalog/controller/common/footer.php
catalog/view/theme/default/template/common/footer.tpl

If your above files already contained changes from
other OpenCart addon modules, then you have to manually merge
your backup copies from step 1) with the changes done to them
from this module, using a text editor.
TIP: You can use changes.txt file for reference


And also enable this feature from Admin->System->Settings See the option tab.
